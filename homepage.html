<H1>What is Environmental Awareness?</H1>
<h3>
	To define environmental awareness we must first understand the environmentalist movement. Environmentalism is an ideology that evokes the necessity and responsibility of humans to respect, protect, and preserve the natural world from its anthropogenic (caused by humans) afflictions.</br>Environmental awareness is an integral part of the movementâ€™s success. By teaching our friends and family that the physical environment is fragile and indispensable we can begin fixing the problems that threaten it.</br>Numerous resources are available to promote environmental awareness; group learning (in or outside of class), informational and inspirational seminars, such as our Awakening the Dreamer Program, and environmental books and brochures are just a few of the tools that can get you involved in promoting the environment.
